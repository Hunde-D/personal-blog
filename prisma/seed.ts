# Hi, I'm Hunde!

I'm a full-stack developer with a deep passion for creating seamless, user-friendly applications. My toolkit includes **React** and **Next.js** for dynamic frontends, **Vue.js** for lightweight interfaces, **Express.js** for robust backends, and **Flutter** for cross-platform mobile apps.

## My Journey
It all started with simple HTML pages back in college, but I quickly fell in love with JavaScript ecosystems. Over the years, I've built everything from habit-tracking apps to e-commerce platforms, always focusing on scalability and maintainability.

## What I Love
- Exploring clean architecture to keep code organized and testable.
- Experimenting with new tools like Prisma for database management and Supabase for real-time features.
- Sharing insights through blogging to help fellow developers avoid common pitfalls.

Outside of coding, you'll find me hiking, reading sci-fi, or tinkering with AI projects. Let's connect and build something amazing!

# Frontend vs Backend: My Perspective

As a full-stack dev, I often navigate the divide between frontend and backend worlds. It's like being a chef who handles both the presentation and the ingredients‚Äîeach side is crucial for a great meal.

## The Frontend Thrill
Frontend development is all about crafting intuitive user experiences. With **React**, I build reusable components that make apps feel alive. **Next.js** takes it further with server-side rendering for blazing-fast performance, and **Vue.js** shines in simpler, reactive UIs.

- Pros: Immediate visual feedback, creative freedom in design.
- Cons: Browser compatibility issues and state management headaches.

## The Backend Backbone
On the flip side, backend work ensures everything runs smoothly behind the scenes. Using **Express.js**, I create APIs that handle data efficiently, paired with **Prisma** for ORM magic and **Supabase** for authentication.

- Pros: Focus on logic, security, and scalability.
- Cons: Debugging can be tricky without direct user interaction.

## Bringing It Together
The real magic happens in full-stack integration. In my recent projects, I've used clean architecture to decouple layers, making maintenance a breeze. If you're starting out, experiment with both‚Äîit's rewarding!

# Clean Architecture in Flutter: My Go-To Approach

Flutter has revolutionized mobile development, but without proper structure, apps can become messy. That's where clean architecture comes in‚Äîit's saved me countless hours on my habit-tracking app.

## Why Clean Architecture?
It divides your app into layers: 
- **Entities**: Core business models (e.g., Habit, Mood).
- **Use Cases**: Business logic (e.g., track streak).
- **Repositories**: Data sources (local DB or API).
- **Presentation**: UI and state (using Provider or Riverpod).

This separation makes your code independent of frameworks, easier to test, and adaptable.

## In Practice
In my app, I implemented features like custom habits and clubs using this setup:

\`\`\`dart
// Example Repository Interface
abstract class HabitRepository {
  Future<List<Habit>> getHabits();
}

// Implementation
class HabitRepositoryImpl implements HabitRepository {
  @override
  Future<List<Habit>> getHabits() async {
    // Fetch from SQLite or API
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Benefits I've Seen
- Unit testing is straightforward‚Äîmock repositories effortlessly.
- Scaling features (e.g., adding mood tracking) doesn't break existing code.
- Collaboration improves with clear boundaries.

If you're building in Flutter, start small with this pattern. It's a game-changer!

# Debugging Like a Pro: My Essential Tips

Bugs are inevitable, but debugging doesn't have to be a nightmare. Over years of working with JS stacks, I've honed techniques that save time and sanity.

## Start with the Basics
- **Console Logs**: Don't underestimate \`console.log()\`. Use it strategically with JSON.stringify for objects.
- **Browser DevTools**: In React or Vue apps, inspect elements, check network tabs, and set breakpoints in sources.

## Advanced Tools
For deeper issues:
- **React DevTools**: Profile components to spot re-renders.
- **Vue DevTools**: Monitor state changes and events.
- **Node Inspector**: Use \`node --inspect\` for backend debugging in Express.

## Common Pitfalls and Fixes
1. **Async Issues**: Wrap awaits in try-catch or use .catch() on promises.
2. **State Mutations**: In React, always use setState; in Vue, avoid direct prop mutations.
3. **Memory Leaks**: Watch for unclosed event listeners‚Äîuse tools like Chrome's Performance tab.

\`\`\`javascript
// Example: Debugging an async function
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api');
    console.log('Data:', await response.json());
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Fetch error:', error);
  }
}
\`\`\`

# Building Dynamic UIs with React and Next.js

React is my frontend powerhouse, and pairing it with Next.js elevates it to full-stack glory. Let's dive into how I build responsive, SEO-friendly apps.

## Core React Concepts
- **Components**: Functional over class-based for hooks like useState and useEffect.
- **State Management**: Redux for complex apps, but Context API suffices for simpler ones.

## Next.js Superpowers
Next.js adds:
- **SSR/SSG**: Pre-render pages for speed and SEO.
- **API Routes**: Build backends without separate servers.

In a recent e-commerce project:

\`\`\`jsx
// Example Page Component
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function ProductPage({ product }) {
  const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{product.name}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setQuantity(q => q + 1)}>Add</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // Fetch data
  return { props: { product: {} } };
}
\`\`\`

## Tips for Success
- Optimize images with Next/Image.
- Handle routing with Link for client-side navigation.
- Test with Jest and React Testing Library.

If you're new to React, start with hooks‚Äîthey're transformative!

      content: `
# Getting Started with Vue.js: My Beginner's Guide

Vue.js is lightweight, flexible, and fun‚Äîideal for devs transitioning from vanilla JS or other frameworks like React.

## Vue Basics
- **Declarative Rendering**: Bind data to DOM with mustache syntax.
- **Reactivity**: Changes in data auto-update the view.

Setup a simple app:

\`\`\`html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"></script>
<div id="app">
  {{ message }}
</div>
<script>
  const { createApp } = Vue;
  createApp({
    data() {
      return { message: 'Hello Vue!' };
    }
  }).mount('#app');
</script>
\`\`\`

## Compared to React
Vue's single-file components (.vue) mix HTML, JS, and CSS neatly, unlike React's JSX. It's less boilerplate-heavy for small projects.

## Advanced Features
- **Composition API**: Hooks-like for better organization.
- **Vue Router**: For SPA navigation.
- **Pinia**: State management that's intuitive.

      content: `
# Crafting Robust APIs with Express.js

Express.js is my backend staple‚Äîsimple yet powerful for Node.js APIs. Here's how I structure them for real-world use.

## Setting Up
Start with:

\`\`\`javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'));
app.listen(3000);
\`\`\`

## Key Features
- **Routing**: Group routes with routers for modularity.
- **Middleware**: Use for auth (e.g., JWT), logging, and error handling.

Integrate with Prisma:

\`\`\`javascript
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
  res.json(users);
});
\`\`\`

## Best Practices
- Validate inputs with Joi or express-validator.
- Secure with helmet and cors.
- Handle errors globally to avoid crashes.

In my projects, Express powers everything from user auth to data syncing. It's reliable‚Äîpair it with Supabase for even more firepower!

        "Tips and tricks to boost Flutter app performance, from widget optimization to efficient state management.",
      content: `
# Optimizing Flutter Performance for Large Apps

Building large-scale Flutter apps, like my habit-tracking app, taught me the importance of performance optimization. Slow renders or laggy UI can ruin user experience, so here‚Äôs how I keep things smooth.

## Widget Optimization
- **Use const Constructors**: For stateless widgets to prevent unnecessary rebuilds.
- **Avoid Large Widget Trees**: Break complex UIs into smaller, reusable widgets.

Example:

\`\`\`dart
const MyWidget = Text('Static Content', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16));
\`\`\`

## State Management
For apps with dynamic data:
- **Provider or Riverpod**: Lightweight and efficient for scoped state changes.
- **Avoid setState Overuse**: Rebuilds entire widget trees unnecessarily.

## Lazy Loading
Load data or widgets only when needed, like paginating lists:

\`\`\`dart
ListView.builder(
  itemCount: items.length,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) => ListTile(title: Text(items[index])),
);
\`\`\`

## Pro Tips
- Use Flutter DevTools to profile performance.
- Optimize images with packages like flutter_image_compress.
- Cache API responses with dio and hive.

Performance tweaks make a huge difference in large apps. Start small, profile often, and keep users happy!

      title: "State Management in React: Choosing the Right Tool",
      excerpt:
        "Comparing useState, Context API, Redux, and Zustand for managing state in React apps.",
      content: `
# State Management in React: My Approach

State management in React can be overwhelming with so many options. Here‚Äôs how I choose between them based on project needs.

## The Basics
- **useState**: Perfect for simple, component-level state.
- **useReducer**: Great for complex component logic.

Example with useState:

\`\`\`jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}
\`\`\`

## Scaling Up
For app-wide state:
- **Context API**: Good for small to medium apps (e.g., theme toggling).
- **Redux**: Ideal for large apps with predictable state flow.
- **Zustand**: Lightweight, modern alternative to Redux.

In my e-commerce app, I used Zustand for cart management:

\`\`\`jsx
import create from 'zustand';

const useStore = create(set => ({
  cart: [],
  addToCart: item => set(state => ({ cart: [...state.cart, item] })),
}));
\`\`\`

## My Advice
- Start with useState and Context.
- Move to Zustand for simpler global state.
- Reserve Redux for complex apps with many contributors.

Choose based on complexity‚Äîdon‚Äôt overengineer!

        "How Vue 3‚Äôs Composition API simplifies logic reuse and improves code organization.",
      content: `
# Vue 3 Composition API: Why I Love It

Vue 3‚Äôs Composition API transformed how I write Vue apps, offering flexibility over the Options API. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a game-changer.

## Why Composition API?
- **Reusability**: Group logic into composables (like hooks in React).
- **Cleaner Code**: No more sprawling Options API objects.

Example composable:

\`\`\`javascript
// useCounter.js
import { ref } from 'vue';

export function useCounter() {
  const count = ref(0);
  const increment = () => count.value++;
  return { count, increment };
}
\`\`\`

Use it:

\`\`\`vue
<script>
import { useCounter } from './useCounter';

export default {
  setup() {
    const { count, increment } = useCounter();
    return { count, increment };
  }
};
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">{{ count }}</button>
</template>
\`\`\`

## Benefits
- **TypeScript Support**: Better type inference.
- **Logic Sharing**: Reuse composables across components.
- **Smaller Bundle Size**: Tree-shaking works better.

For dashboards or forms, Composition API keeps my code modular. If you‚Äôre on Vue 2, upgrade for this alone!

      content: `
# Securing Express APIs with JWT

Building secure APIs is critical, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are my go-to for authentication in Express apps. Here‚Äôs my approach.

## Setting Up JWT
Install dependencies:

\`\`\`bash
npm install jsonwebtoken bcrypt
\`\`\`

Create a login route:

\`\`\`javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { email } });
  if (user && await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password)) {
    const token = jwt.sign({ id: user.id }, 'secret', { expiresIn: '1h' });
    res.json({ token });
  } else {
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' });
  }
});
\`\`\`

## Protecting Routes
Use middleware:

\`\`\`javascript
function authMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ error: 'No token' });
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'secret');
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
  }
}

app.get('/protected', authMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Protected data', user: req.user });
});
\`\`\`

## Best Practices
- Store secrets in environment variables.
- Use refresh tokens for long-lived sessions.
- Hash passwords with bcrypt.

JWT keeps my APIs secure and scalable. Pair it with Prisma for user management!

# Testing Flutter Apps: My Strategy

Testing is a lifesaver for Flutter apps, especially for complex ones like my habit-tracker. Here‚Äôs how I approach unit and widget testing.

## Unit Tests
Test business logic in isolation:

\`\`\`dart
import 'package:test/test.dart';
import 'package:my_app/habit_service.dart';

void main() {
  test('Habit streak increments correctly', () {
    final service = HabitService();
    expect(service.incrementStreak(1), 2);
  });
}
\`\`\`

## Widget Tests
Test UI components:

\`\`\`dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:my_app/main.dart';

void main() {
  testWidgets('Counter increments', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    await tester.pumpWidget(MyApp());
    expect(find.text('0'), findsOneWidget);
    await tester.tap(find.byType(ElevatedButton));
    await tester.pump();
    expect(find.text('1'), findsOneWidget);
  });
}
\`\`\`

## Tips for Success
- Mock dependencies with mockito.
- Use flutter_test for widget testing.
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automation.
